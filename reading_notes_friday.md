*Welcome to your fourth and LAST reading notes file of the week! Reading notes are important because they will help you reinforce what you have learned and help you master the syntax of markdown (which is what I'm writing for you here :D )! The following questions will be for you to answer from the reading and give you a chance to add any thoughts or comments on what you have learned. The more you write, the more you can interpret the concepts you learn* ;)


## HTML:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?
    - For accessibility purposes the 'alt' tag allows you to enter text that can be read if an image or link cannot be seen. 

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
    - By adding at 'alt' tag to with the <a href>.

3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.
    - One specific purpose could be giving a brief comment on an image, or a person's name to an image of them.

4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
    - A gif is a compressed image or video on a webpage. It's the difference between a photo and a painting or cross-stitch of the same image. 

    - Svg is a container for images that creates structure for the  image within the container. Imagine a jello mold, but for images.  

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
    - If you're looking for a high resolution, potentially lossless format you would use PNG or JPEG. Preferably PNG. JPEG can reproduce with good fidelity but can produce noise in the image.

## CSS:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)


1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
     - Foreground colors change the color of the text you see on a website.
     - Background colors change, well, the background of a webpage you're using. 

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up.  How would you use color to give his blog some character?
    - You can change the color of the background, font, tables, etc. Almost everything on a webpage can be given a custom touch. 

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
    - READABILITY.
    - You should have consistent stylings and be aware of the tone of your message. You don't want to be a funeral home using Comic Sans. 

4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?
    - Font size changes the size of the font.
    - Font weight changes the emphasis on the font (bold, italics, etc)
    - Font style changes the type-set or appearance of the font.

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.
    - Letter-spacing to add space between the letters
    - Word-spacing to add space between the words.
